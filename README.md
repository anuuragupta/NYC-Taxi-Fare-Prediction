<n><strong>This given task involves predicting the fare for New York City taxis using a Random Forest Regressor model. This machine learning algorithm uses an ensemble of decision trees and various input features, such as pick-up and drop-off location, distance traveled, and time of day, to predict the fare for a given taxi ride. The model has achieved an accuracy of 98%, indicating that it can effectively predict the taxi fare. This high accuracy makes the model a useful tool for taxi companies and customers to estimate the cost of a ride accurately. However, it is essential to note that further testing and validation are necessary to ensure the model's accuracy on new, unseen data.</strong></n>
